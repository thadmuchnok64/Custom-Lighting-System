# Custom-Lighting-System
Here's the Lighting System that I use in my games

I made this in order to circumvent Unity's wacky lighting system. I didnt like how Unity's lights were super bright near the center and super dim near the end of the radius. Even drastically increasing the range didnt help. This lighting system lets you get a more sylized lighting effect and harder shadows.

:D
